A 2D farming simulator with a variety of creatures that can be befriended to assist you around the farm. Use tools and creatures to manage various plants on a farm by tilling the soil, planting seeds, and harvesting them. Creatures are capable of assisting around the farm with the use of their mysterious powers with abilities like watering plants, harvesting certain types of plants, defending your base, etc. Oh yeah, the creatures can fight each other using abilities and physical attacks.
