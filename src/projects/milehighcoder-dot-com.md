A static HTML website built using the NodeJS package Eleventy. This is my personal website that represents myself as a software engineer and game developer, full of info about myself and my projects. This site is a continuous work in progress as I try and shape it into the best reflection of myself.

## Features

- **Automated CI/CD**: Changes on GitHub are automatically tracked and a cloud build is triggers that lints the projects, builds the static site, and uploads it to the static site host.
- **Image Optimization**: Images are automatically processed during the build process so still images are optimized for the web.
