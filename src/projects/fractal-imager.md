A small application I made to show my love for this wonderful fractal. Generate high-resolution images of the Mandelbrot set and explore it with customizable parameters. Images of these fantastic fractals are made by writing data directly to a bitmap file, so this should run about anything.

I encourage you to play with the parameters and see what beauty you can find.
