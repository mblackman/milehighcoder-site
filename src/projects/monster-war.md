Monster War is a turn-based RPG inspired by the Pok√©mon series, but with a darker and more strategic focus. Players take on the role of a young monster trainer in a world unknowingly embroiled in a secret war. Initially focused on training monsters and competing in battles, the player is eventually thrust into the heart of the conflict, facing difficult choices and fighting to liberate their homeland.

## Features

- **Pathfinding**: A custom grid-based pathfinding system using an A\* pathfinding algorithm for complex ai movement and simple player control.
- **Dynamic Battle System**: Battles will be highly customizable thanks to a modular turn-based combat system that supports a wide range of attack types and strategies.
